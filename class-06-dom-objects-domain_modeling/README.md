# Class 6: The DOM, Domain Modeling, and Introduction to Objects

<a id="top"></a>
## Today's Plan: Week 2, Monday Lecture

- [Announcements, Code Review, Q&A](#codereview) *[30 minutes]*
- Domain modeling *[30 minutes]*

`10-minute break`

- Object literals *[30 minutes]*
- The DOM *[30 minutes]*

`10-minute break`

- Lab prep *[45 minutes]*

## One-on-one meetings

- Sam will do 15-minute one-on-one meetings with each student during Weeks 2 and 4 of the course. We will have those meetings on Wednesday through Friday afternoons this week.
- The goal of the meetings is to provide an opportunity for individual feedback and for students to ask any questions they may have.
- [Click here for the link to book a time; be sure to make a note of your time, as you will not be able to go back into the system and view it later.](https://sam-201d40.youcanbook.me)
- The meetings will be done in one of the little conference rooms in "The Catacombs"; just head over at your time.

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 6 of Code 201, students will:

- Be able to translate a real-world problem domain into a code model by using provided user stories and technical requirements, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Demonstrate an understanding of how the browser represents an HTML document as an object that can be manipulated with JavaScript, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Use JavaScript to dynamically render array data as an unordered list in the DOM, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Demonstrate an understanding of how object literals are structured in JavaScript, as well as how to access and reassign values/functionality to their properties and methods, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Demonstrate an understanding of how dot notation and bracket notation are used to access/reassign properties and methods in JavaScript objects, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
